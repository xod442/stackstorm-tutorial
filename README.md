## Tutorial

In this tutorial we will build a stackstorm action that will get the Astronomical Picture of the Day (apod)
from a nasa website. Once we get the data from the nasa server we will assign it to a local variable and
post a message in the rabbitmq bus.

To do this we will load the rabbitmq pack and test writing messages to it.

Finally we will write a sensor that monitors the rabbitmq looking for new messages, if found, we will
call another stackstorm action to write the link to an html index file.
